          Since graduating from App Academy in July 2020, I have been spending
          8-12 hours a day doubling my knowledge and skills via continuing
          implementing features on my projects, devouring additional courses and
          most recently, working as a Junior Developer at Solvana, a startup
          dedicated to solar energy (Karvana for solar). In this collaboration,
          I've been learning valuable new technologies such as Typescript, Jest,
          React Hooks, MaterialUI and AWS Lambda.
